# A Cyberpunk racing mod

## Requirements
- This mod requires you to OWN CyberPunk 2077
- Aside from this you need to have [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107) installed and working

## Installation
Simply store this project in your default mods directory (probably `.Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods`) and start the game

## Usage
### Keybindings
Set all keybindings that don't have the `DEV:` prefix.
This mod doesn't trigger races by itself, instead you will need to tell it that you want to race (by calling the `Find a new Race` key).

### Creating new Races
I very much appreciate it if you want to create new Races. To do so go to a starting position, press the `DEV: Set this as the start point for a race` button and start driving. Once you've arrived at your imagined finish line, press the `DEV: The race is finished here` button.
Then you'll need to go to the Cyber Engine Tweaks console and copy the printed information, and put it into the `Races.lua` file.
